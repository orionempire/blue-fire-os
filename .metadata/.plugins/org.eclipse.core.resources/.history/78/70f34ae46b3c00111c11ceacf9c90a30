Welcome to BlueFire OS! Blue Fire is a didactic OS that was created to show every step of creating a bootstrapping OS.

Design Goals
Unified tool set 		- At first every thing needed to develop the OS is available in Linux (as of this writing Bochs Debugger is lacking and is done in windows).
Bootstrapping			- The hope is that by the end of the project the OS can build its self.
Open source Protocols   - Only open source data constructs are used I.E. ext2 everywhere no fat12
One effective way only	- The goal is understanding not ubiquity the OS is designed to work on a reference architecture and nothing else.

Limitations
	Until XX.XX.XX
		1 MB kernel size limit		- the kernel is loaded from a 1 MB reserved section of the boot floppy.
		Sytem memory is hard coded 	- will be calculated later. Currently hard coded to 128MB at stage2/stage2.asm. Must be changed if system memory amount changes.
		  

BlueFire OS - Version 00 - From boot sector to shell.
	BlueFire OS - 00.00 -> Stage 1 and Stage 2
		BlueFire OS - 00.00.01 -> hello world boot sector
		BlueFire OS - 00.00.02 -> functional boot sector that loads stage 2 and displays message
		BlueFire OS - 00.00.03 -> stage 2 enable a20, GDT, map memory, load kernel, enable paging, hello world from kernel
		BlueFire OS - 00.00.04 -> 
		BlueFire OS - 00.00.05 -> 
		BlueFire OS - 00.00.06 ->  
		BlueFire OS - 00.00.08 ->  
	  	BlueFire OS - 00.00.09 ->  
	  	BlueFire OS - 00.00.10 -> 
	  	BlueFire OS - 00.00.11 ->
