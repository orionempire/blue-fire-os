Welcome to BlueFire OS! Blue Fire is a didactic OS that was created to show every step of creating a bootstrapping OS.

Design Goals
Unified tool set 		- At first every thing needed to develop the OS is available in Linux (as of this writing Bochs Debugger is lacking and is done in windows).
Bootstrapping			- The hope is that by the end of the project the OS can build its self.
Open source Protocols   - Only open source data constructs are used I.E. ext2 everywhere no fat12
One effective way only	- The goal is understanding not ubiquity the OS is designed to work on a reference architecture and nothing else.
