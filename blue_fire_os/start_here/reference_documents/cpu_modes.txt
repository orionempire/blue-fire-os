Segment register basics
Most memory accesses implicitly or explicitly use a segment register.
	- To fetch instructions the CPU unconditionally uses the CS register.
    - For most data accesses the CPU uses the DS register by default.
    - When implicitly using DI or EDI in a string instruction, the CPU unconditionally uses the ES register.
    - When implicitly using SP or ESP as a stack pointer the CPU unconditionally uses the SS register.
    - When using BP, EBP, or ESP explicitly as a base register the CPU uses the SS register by default. 

	In the cases in which DS or SS would be used by default, the choice of segment register may be overridden by a segment prefix.

	The CPU first computes an offset. In 16-bit addressing the CPU truncates the offset to the low 16 bits. The CPU then adds the offset to the segment-base provided by the selected segment register. This yields the linear address that will be accessed.
