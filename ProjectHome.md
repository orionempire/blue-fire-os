### Welcome to Bluefire OS, Bluefire is a didactic OS that was created to show every step of creating a bootstrapping OS. ###

<pre>
Design Goals<br>
<br>
A teaching OS		- The primary mission is to teach OS design. Elegance and advance features are routinely used but never at the expense of the primary goal.<br>
Unified tool set 	- At first every thing needed to develop the OS is available in Linux (as of this writing Bochs Debugger is lacking and is done in windows).<br>
Bootstrapping		- The hope is that by the end of the project the OS can build its self.<br>
Open source Protocols   - Only open source data constructs are used I.E. ext2 everywhere no fat12<br>
One effective way only	- The goal is understanding not ubiquity so the OS is designed to work on a reference architecture and nothing else.<br>
